# Workflow Best Practices

- Pin action versions (avoid `@latest`).
- Use least-privilege `permissions`.
- Cache dependencies for faster builds.
- Use concurrency controls to avoid duplicate deployments.
- Use environments for approvals and secrets scoping.
- Prefer reusable workflows for shared patterns.
- Keep secrets out of logs.
